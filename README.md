# IMDB Movie Recommendation System

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the use of various recommendation algorithms on the IMDB movies dataset. The goal is to create a POC for a movie recommendation system for a new movie streaming company. The system recommends ten movies for each user to watch next and predicts how they would rate these movies.

## Dataset Description

The IMDB movies dataset contains metadata for all 45,000 movies listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset, including cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts, and vote averages. The dataset also includes files containing 26 million ratings from 270,000 users for all 45,000 movies. Ratings are on a scale of 1-5 and have been obtained from the official GroupLens website.

## Technologies Used

The notebook uses various recommendation algorithms such as Apriori, Eclat, Markov Chains, Surprise, SVD, and Vector Spaces. These techniques are implemented using Python libraries such as mlxtend, Markovify, Surprise, and Scikit-learn.

## Contents

1. Loading and preprocessing the dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset
3. Recommendation algorithms: Apriori, Eclat, Markov Chains, Surprise, SVD, and Vector Spaces
4. Evaluation of the recommendation algorithms
5. Conclusion and Future Work

This notebook is suitable for anyone interested in learning about recommendation systems and how to apply them to real-world datasets like the IMDB movies dataset.
